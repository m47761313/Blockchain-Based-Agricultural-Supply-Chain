# Blockchain-Based Agricultural Supply Chain

This repository implements a blockchain solution for agricultural supply chain management, providing transparency, traceability, and trust from farm to table.

## Overview

The system transforms traditional agricultural supply chains into a decentralized process using specialized smart contracts that handle different aspects of food production and distribution:

- **Farm Verification**: Validates legitimate agricultural producers and their practices
- **Crop Tracking**: Records planting, treatment, and harvesting with immutable history
- **Transportation Verification**: Tracks movement of produce through the supply chain
- **Quality Certification**: Records inspection results and compliance with standards
- **Retail Distribution**: Manages final delivery to consumers with complete provenance

## Architecture

The system consists of five core smart contracts that work together to manage the agricultural supply chain:

1. **FarmVerification.sol**: Validates farm identity, location, and certifications
2. **CropTracking.sol**: Monitors and records all stages of crop production
3. **TransportationVerification.sol**: Tracks logistics and handling conditions
4. **QualityCertification.sol**: Manages inspection and certification processes
5. **RetailDistribution.sol**: Handles final distribution and consumer-facing information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum development environment (Truffle, Hardhat, or similar)
- Solidity compiler (version 0.8.0 or higher recommended)
- Web3.js or ethers.js for frontend integration
- MetaMask or similar wallet for testing

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-agriculture.git
   cd blockchain-agriculture
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

## Usage

### Deploying Contracts

Deploy the contracts to your preferred network:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

### Workflow

1. **Farm Registration**: Agricultural producers register and verify their operations
2. **Crop Management**: Farmers record planting, treatment, and harvesting events
3. **Transport Logging**: Shipment details and conditions are tracked in transit
4. **Quality Assurance**: Inspections and certifications are recorded at key points
5. **Retail Integration**: Final distribution to consumers with complete traceability
6. **Consumer Access**: End users can verify the complete history of their food

## Security Considerations

- IoT device integration for automated data collection
- Oracle integration for verified off-chain data
- Role-based access controls for different supply chain participants
- Privacy protections for sensitive business information
- Regular security audits recommended before production use

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with weather and climate data
- Automated compliance monitoring for regulatory requirements
- Tokenized incentive system for sustainable farming practices
- Machine learning for yield optimization and quality prediction
- Consumer-facing mobile app for product verification
